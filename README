| MY GRADUATION PROJECT |
+-----------------------+

The project is under development and is to be delivered in June 2016.

Manifesto:
----------
doc/        Detailed documentation for my work
firmware/   Firmware program for MIPS computer
hardware/   VHDL code for the machine
mipsemu/    MIPS computer emulator
vhdsim/     VHDL code simulation with nvc (VHPI)

Notes:
------
-> You need gcc and SDL to compile the emulator (mipsemu).
-> You need to cross compile binutils and gcc to compile the firmware
   * For binutils, you may use "cross-mipsel-linux-gnu-binutils".
   * For gcc, you may use "cross-mipsel-linux-gnu-gcc".
